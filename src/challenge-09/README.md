# CHALLENGE #9: THE RENO ROBOT ASPIRATOR

> **Level**: MEDIUM

The elves have built a robot vacuum reindeer (`R`) to tidy up the workshop a bit before Christmas.
The reindeer moves on a board to pick things up off the floor (`*`) and must avoid obstacles (`#`).

You will receive two parameters:

- `board`: a string that represents the board.
- `moves`: a string with the movements: `'L'` (left), `'R'` (right), `'U'` (up), `'D'` (down).

Movement rules:

- If the reindeer picks something up off the floor (`*`) during the moves -> return `'success'`.
- If the reindeer goes off the board or crashes into an obstacle (`#`) -> return `'crash'`.
- If the reindeer neither picks anything up nor crashes -> return `'fail'`.

Keep in mind that if the reindeer picks something up off the floor, it is already `'success'`, regardless of whether in later moves it crashes into an obstacle or goes off the board.

Important: Keep in mind that in the board the first and last lines are blank and must be discarded.

Examples in the transcription show expected behaviors.
