# CHALLENGE #13: THE ASSEMBLY LINE

> **Level**: MEDIUM

Simulate the path of a gift that starts at position (0,0). Each cell contains one of `>`, `<`, `^`, `v` indicating movement, or `.` which means a correct exit.

Return `'completed'` if the gift reaches `.`, `'loop'` if it visits a position twice, or `'broken'` if it leaves the board.
