# CHALLENGE #7: DECORATING THE TREE

> **Level**: MEDIUM

It's time to decorate the Christmas tree! Write a function that receives:

- `height` -> the height of the tree (number of rows).
- `ornament` -> the ornament character (for example, "o" or "a").
- `frequency` -> how often (in asterisk positions) the ornament appears.

The tree is drawn with asterisks `*`, but every `frequency` positions, the asterisk is replaced by the ornament.
The position counting starts at 1, from the top to the bottom, left to right. If `frequency` is 2, the ornaments appear in positions 2, 4, 6, etc.

The tree must be centered and have a one-line trunk `#` at the end.

Examples:

```javascript
drawTree(5, 'o', 2)
/*
		*
	 o*o
	*o*o*
 o*o*o*o
*o*o*o*o*
		#
*/

drawTree(3, '@', 3)
/*
	*
 *a* <-- (Note: example image showed 'a' but parameter is '@')
*a**a
	#
*/

drawTree(4, '+', 1)
/*
	 +
	+++
 +++++
++++++
	 #
*/
```
