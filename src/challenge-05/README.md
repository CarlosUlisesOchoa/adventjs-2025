# CHALLENGE #5: THE COUNTDOWN TO TAKE OFF

> **Level**: EASY

Elves have a secret timestamp: it's the exact date and time when Santa Claus takes off with the sleigh to deliver gifts around the world. But at the North Pole they use a super weird format to store the time: `YYYY*MM*DD@HH|mm|ss NP` (example: `2025*12*25@00|00|00 NP`).

Your mission is to write a function that receives:

- `fromTime` -> reference date in elf format (`YYYY*MM*DD@HH|mm|ss NP`).
- `takeOffTime` -> the same takeoff date, also in elf format.

The function must return:

- The full seconds remaining until takeoff.
- If we're exactly at takeoff time -> `0`.
- If takeoff already happened -> a negative number indicating how many seconds have passed since then.

Rules

- First convert the elf format to a timestamp. The `NP` suffix indicates official North Pole time (no time zones or DST), so you can treat it as if it were UTC.
- Use differences in seconds, not milliseconds.
- Always round down (floor): only full seconds.

Examples:

```javascript
const takeoff = '2025*12*25@00|00|00 NP'

// from December 24, 2025, 23:59:30, 30 seconds before takeoff
timeUntilTakeOff('2025*12*24@23|59|30 NP', takeoff)
// 30

// exactly at takeoff time
timeUntilTakeOff('2025*12*25@00|00|00 NP', takeoff)
// 0

// 12 seconds after takeoff
timeUntilTakeOff('2025*12*25@00|00|12 NP', takeoff)
// -12
```
